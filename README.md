# Button Click and Calculation Functions: 
This section defines functions for handling button clicks and performing calculations. 
The button_click function is called when a number or operation button is clicked, and it appends the clicked button's text to the current expression. 
The calculate function evaluates the expression and displays the result. 
There are also separate functions for handling square root, exponentiation, percentage, sine, cosine, and tangent calculations.

# Create the Main Window: 
This section creates the main window using the `tkinter.Tk()` class. 
It sets the window title and background color.

# Custom Fonts and Result Label: 
This section defines custom fonts for buttons and the result label. 
It creates an Entry widget for displaying the result, which is a text box that supports text input and output.

# Number Buttons: 
This section creates the number buttons using a loop. Each button is defined with its text, position (row and column), and properties such as background color, font, and padding. 
The buttons are associated with the `button_click` function, which updates the expression when clicked.

# Operation Buttons: 
Similar to the number buttons, this section creates operation buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and equals. 
The buttons are associated with the `button_click` function.

# Function Buttons: 
This section creates buttons for functions such as square root, square, percentage, sine, cosine, and tangent. 
Additional functions like logarithm, floor, factorial, absolute value, reciprocal, and exponentiation are also included. 
The buttons are associated with the `button_click function`.

# Clear Button: 
This section creates a clear button that calls the clear function to clear the expression and result.

# Configure Resizing: 
This section configures the column and row weights to allow resizing of the buttons and result label when the window size changes.

# Start the Event Loop: 
The final part of the code starts the main event loop, which waits for user interactions and updates the window accordingly.

# Conclusion
The code creates a simple calculator GUI with number buttons, operation buttons, function buttons, and a result display. 
Users can input expressions, perform calculations, and view the results in real-time.
